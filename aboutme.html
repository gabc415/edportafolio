About the Author

I am an experienced chemist and educator with a focus on organic synthesis and materials, currently completing my Ph.D. in Chemistry at the University of Nevada, Reno. My teaching role has primarily involved instructing both lower-division and upper-division undergraduate courses in chemistry labs and chemistry writing, where I developed engaging lesson plans, mentored students, and assessed their progress. My teaching approach emphasizes active learning and problem-solving to foster a deeper understanding of chemical principles. This semester, I am further exploring the integration of technology into my teaching practices, with the goal of enhancing student learning and engagement in chemistry through the use of innovative digital tools and strategies, specifically focusing on incorporating simulations and online collaborative platforms. My background in both academic research and in training deep learning models for science content provides a unique perspective for leveraging technology in education.
